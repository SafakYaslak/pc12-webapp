The cell analysis module employs advanced segmentation algorithms to identify and quantify individual cells within microscopy images. The system performs comprehensive morphological analysis including precise cell boundary detection using contour-based algorithms, automated cell counting with overlap resolution, individual cell area calculations with sub-pixel accuracy, and statistical analysis of cell populations including density distributions and size variations.

### Neural Branch Network Analysis
The branch analysis component specializes in quantifying complex neural structures and branching patterns. This sophisticated analysis includes automated detection of branch structures using skeletonization algorithms, precise length measurements for individual branches, comprehensive angle calculations between branching points, automated assignment of branches to parent cells, and detailed network topology analysis including junction identification and branch ordering.

### Advanced Visualization System
The platform provides an interactive visualization environment that enables researchers to validate and interpret results effectively. The visualization system features real-time side-by-side comparison of original and processed images, dynamic threshold adjustment with immediate visual feedback, interactive overlay systems for highlighting detected features, and comprehensive annotation tools for marking regions of interest.

### Comprehensive Data Export
All analysis results are available for export in multiple formats suitable for further statistical analysis and publication. The export system generates detailed statistical reports including all measurements and calculations, formatted text files compatible with statistical software packages, summary tables with key metrics and distributions, and raw data exports for custom analysis workflows.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Implementation
The user interface is built using modern web technologies including React.js with TypeScript for type-safe component development, Tailwind CSS for responsive and consistent styling, Lucide React for professional iconography, and Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions. The frontend architecture emphasizes usability and accessibility, ensuring that complex analytical tools remain intuitive for researchers with varying technical backgrounds.

### Backend Infrastructure
The backend processing engine is implemented in Python, utilizing Flask for API development and request handling, OpenCV for comprehensive image processing operations, TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning model deployment, and scikit-image for specialized morphological operations. The architecture is designed for scalability and can handle multiple concurrent analysis requests while maintaining processing speed and accuracy.

### Deep Learning Models
The platform incorporates custom-trained neural networks specifically optimized for biological image analysis. The segmentation pipeline uses a modified UNet architecture trained on diverse microscopy datasets, ensuring robust performance across different imaging conditions and cell types. Post-processing algorithms include morphological operations for noise reduction and feature enhancement, connected component analysis for object identification and separation, and advanced contour detection for precise boundary determination.

## Installation and Setup

### System Requirements
Before installation, ensure your system meets the following requirements: Python 3.9 or higher with pip package manager, Node.js version 14 or higher with npm or yarn, at least 8GB of RAM for optimal performance, and sufficient storage space for image processing and model files.

### Backend Configuration
Begin by cloning the repository from the official source and navigating to the backend directory. Create a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies and prevent conflicts with system packages. Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for your operating system. Install all required Python dependencies using the provided requirements file, which includes all necessary packages with version specifications for stability.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SafakYaslak/pc12-webapp.git
cd imageai-analysis/backend
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows users:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Unix/MacOS users:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Configuration
Navigate to the project root directory and install all Node.js dependencies. The package.json file contains all required frontend libraries and their compatible versions. Use either npm or yarn based on your preference, as both package managers are supported.

```bash
cd imageai-analysis
npm install
# Alternative: yarn install
```

## Application Deployment

### Starting the Backend Server
Launch the Flask backend server by running the main application file. The server will initialize the deep learning models, establish API endpoints, and begin listening for requests. Monitor the console output for any initialization messages or errors.

```bash
# From the backend directory
python main_app.py
```

### Starting the Frontend Development Server
In a separate terminal window, start the React development server. This will compile the frontend application and serve it with hot-reload capabilities for development purposes.

```bash
# From the project root
npm run dev
# Alternative: yarn dev
```

## User Guide

### Image Upload Process
The platform accepts various image formats including JPEG, PNG, and TIFF files with a maximum size limit of 10MB. When uploading images, ensure they are of sufficient resolution for accurate analysis, typically 512x512 pixels or higher. The system automatically handles image preprocessing including resizing and normalization.

### Analysis Configuration
Select the appropriate analysis type based on your research objectives. Cell analysis is optimized for counting and measuring individual cells, while branch analysis focuses on neural network structures and connectivity patterns. Adjust threshold parameters using the interactive slider to optimize detection sensitivity for your specific image characteristics.

### Results Interpretation
The platform provides comprehensive results including quantitative measurements, statistical analysis, and visual validation tools. Review the processed images to verify detection accuracy, examine the statistical summary for key metrics, and use the export function to save results for further analysis.

## Analysis Methodologies

### Cell Analysis Pipeline
The cell analysis workflow begins with image preprocessing to enhance contrast and reduce noise. The segmentation stage uses deep learning models to identify cell boundaries with high precision. Post-processing includes morphological operations to refine detection results and eliminate artifacts. The measurement phase calculates individual cell areas, total cell count, and population statistics including mean area, standard deviation, and distribution patterns.

### Branch Analysis Pipeline
Branch analysis employs a sophisticated multi-stage approach starting with image enhancement specifically tuned for linear structures. The segmentation phase identifies branch-like structures using specialized filters and machine learning models. Skeletonization algorithms reduce detected branches to single-pixel-wide representations for accurate length measurements. The analysis phase includes branch tracing to determine connectivity, angle calculations at junction points, and assignment of branches to their respective cell bodies.

## Performance Specifications

### Processing Capabilities
The platform is optimized for efficiency and accuracy, typically processing standard microscopy images within 2-5 seconds per image. The system supports images up to 10MB in size and can handle batch processing for multiple images. GPU acceleration is available when compatible hardware is present, significantly reducing processing time for large datasets.
